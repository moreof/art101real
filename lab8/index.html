			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
            <p> Work with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The primary challenge of this lab was to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks in the browser and in our code editor. I had some challenges with the map array and anonymous functions, but I ended up figuring it out a little better.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had difficulty with the anonymous function to perform a new math function on the defined array within the browser, and ended up asking an AI chatbot (DeepAI) about a way to write the function. I wasn't familiar with the use of an arrow within the function, but I was able to do a little more research after to figure out how this function operates. Personal circumstances also made it difficult to complete on time, and I accidentally performed the beginning steps in my VS code rather than in my browser, so I had to go back and figure out what I was doing all over again.</p>
                    </div>                
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was one of the more challenging labs I've worked on, due to personal circumstances but also my inexperience with javascript functions and with computer science in general. I'm still a little uncertain about anonymous functions still. I'm also still struggling a bit to figure out CSS image scaling (mostly struggling to find the time to adequately study it), so I apologize for how messy this page looks, but I'm already late on this assignment.</p>
