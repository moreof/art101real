			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for this lab was to incorporate an API into our javascript program.</p>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit with getting the API linked and with loading the YuJa lecture capture, so I ended up mostly looking through the slides and online resources to learn a bit more and troubleshoot. I mostly ended up replicating parts of what I read on forums, but changing the different elements of it to my specifications.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was really interesting to learn about APIs and how to incorporate them, and the potentials that this creates for the kind of coding I could try and do in the future. This lab helped provide a glimpse for me of what could be doable with Javascript and through coding, which I'd like to continue trying to practice and engage with.</p>
