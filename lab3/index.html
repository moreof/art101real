			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The primary challenge of this lab was to arrange the index of our art101 repositories as a more fleshed out website, and to create an unsorted list of the labs we've linked on so that this index could function as a homepage.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was having issues prior to this lab with my repository, and ended up having to re-clone it and move the files I edited into the new one manually. It took me a while to get that working, but we already had a bit of an index template to work from, so that part didn't end up as challenging. My main challenges were in getting my CSS to interact with my html properly, which was mostly because I forgot to use semicolons or forgot how to target within a certain class or ID.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>At this point I feel that this went relatively well, but I did about half of it in a pretty quick rush because I'd been getting nervous about my repository not working and my site not being up. Once I was less stressed and frantic, it seemed even less daunting, and I felt more confident in this assignment. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<img id="filestructure" src="./img/filestructure.png">
						<p>This is the file structure as it displays in Windows, although I did have to reproduce the repository as 'art101real' due to an issue with my previous repository.</p>
						<img id="indexhtml" src="./img/art101indexhtml.png">
						<p>This is the html I used for my homepage/index site.</p>
						<img id="indexsite" src="./img/indexsite1.png">
						<img id="indexsite2" src="./img/indexsite2.png">
						<p>This is the website it produced! Broken into two images because of how large the image came out.</p>
						<img id="lab3html" src="./img/lab3html.png">
						<p>This was the html I used for my lab 3 website.</p>
