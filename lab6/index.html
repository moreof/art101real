			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The first challenge of this lab was to code an array of our transporation options in our browser console with javascript, and identify one as 'myMainRide' with identifiable properties. We then coded these options into a javascript program in a lab6 file, which we linked to from an html file on an index page we upload to our github websites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a few minor problems that set me back a bit, but nothing outside the usual slipups. Occasionally, I would forget to use both parentheses and quotation marks to designate something, or I would use a semicolon in a place which shouldn't have one, and so on. I had trouble with the line break in the script output specifically, until I realized it needed to be within both the angled brackets and quotation marks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went really well over all, and I used this as an opportunity to finally go back and update each of my lab CSS stylesheets to match. I consulted WesBot for the line break challenges I was having as well, which pointed out my error before. I'm not a huge fan of how this CSS stylesheet looks at this point, so I'll probably update it at some point as well. I'm trying to go back and give each of my lab pages a button to return to the home page as well, but at the time of completing this lab I don't have it working yet.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p>This is the script output I produced in my javascript file, replicating what I did in the browser at the beginning of this lab. I've attached the screenshots I took through this lab beneath the script output as well.</p>
