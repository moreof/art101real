					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The primary challenge of this lab was to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with getting the output to display on the HTML page without vanishing immediately, and requested assistance from the program DeepAI which pointed out that the way I referred to the output div in my html didn't actually contain the button section.</p>
                    </div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I asked an AI program about some of my code for this one. It took a bit of work, because I kept thinking that the issue was with my javascript, but none of the feedback I got for it alone either fixed it or even lead to a coherent answer - after a few times, I asked it if it spotted any errors in the javascript and related HTML, and it pointed out that my div began and ended without incorporating the button. It was helpful to bounce my work off of, and reminded me to stay wary of my calls and the intricate details.</p>
