			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
            <p> Create functions that accept user input.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a javascript function which can receive, sort, and display user input through an associated HTML file we also designed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems getting my commands to work on the first try, particularly regarding variables. I initially planned to be a little "clever" with my js and accomplish more tasks in fewer lines of code, but I had difficulty figuring out how to appropriately log and store the information throughout that process to display. I also realized much later that the sort function didn't seem to work with apostrophes in its variable parameters, though the other tasks did./p>
                    </div>                
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was much more doable than I had anticipated, which I think was definitely helped by the work we did in our section. I'm still incredibly nervous because I know that this is just the beginning of what javascript can do, and what we'll end up doing with it, but at the moment I'm somewhat confident in my ability to complete this lab.</p>
