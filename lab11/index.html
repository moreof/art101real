			<h1>Lab 11 - Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The primary challenge of this lab was to experiment with javascript events by getting a value from an input field and modifying it in the output field.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have that many problems with this lab, although there was the usual amount of troubleshooting with my own minor errors like ordering my commands wrong or forgetting to put a parentheses somewhere.</p>
                    </div>                
			<div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was fun to try and work out, and it's really interesting to continue to see what can be done with javascript.</p>
