			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to use javascript in order to code the attributes of our vehicle and depict them in a list with javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I initially faced challenges with my html, as it wasn't displaying the output from the javascript properly. I edited the "script" command a bit to change its link to my lab 5 css, but it only started working when I restored it to the previous version (mine was called lab5, and didn't want to be linked to with a .js).</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assigment went well, and I was able to get it done pretty efficiently. As I mentioned, I had some issues linking my javascript output with my html, but as you can see below - I got it working!</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p> This lab went pretty well, here's the working list. I've attached some screenshots below.</p>
