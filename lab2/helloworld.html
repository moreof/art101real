            <p> My name is Morris and I'm a fourth year community studies and politics major. I don't have any coding experience, but I'm excited to learn more, particularly in relation to the arts. I spend a lot of my time doing readings for courses and working. In my free time, I enjoy baking, watching movies, and going on hikes. My partner, Fatima, is also a Community Studies major.</p>
