// Making sourdough starter
// 1. Verify that you have the required materials: whole wheat flour, non-chlorinated water, a glass bowl, a resealable glass jar or similar container, a measuring cup, a cheesecloth, and a fork.
// 2. Measure out one cup of whole wheat flour in your measuring cup.
// 3. Add this flour to the glass bowl.
// 4. Measure out three fourths of a cup of water in your measuring cup.
// 5. Add this water to the glass bowl.
// 6. Mix the flour and water together in the bowl using the fork until a dough is formed, and there is little to no loose flour visible.
// 7. Loosely cover the bowl with the cheesecloth, and let sit approximately 24 hours in a warm spot (75-80 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal).
// 8. After 24 hours have passed, remove the cheesecloth and mix the dough with the fork well.
// 9. Measure out half a cup of this dough and discard it.
// 10. Add half of a cup of flour to the remaining dough in the bowl.
// 11. Add three eighths of a cup (or six tablespoons) of water to the remaining dough in the bowl.
// 12. Mix the newly added flour and water into the dough with the fork until there is little to no loose flour visible.
// 13. Repeat steps 7 through 12 until six days have passed.
// 14. Check the strength and bubbliness of your dough mixture; if the mixture is not yet bubbling, begin feeding your mixture twice a day (performing steps 10-12 is “feeding”).
// 15. Cover the bowl loosely with a cheesecloth, and wait another 24 hours.
// 16. On day 7, your sourdough starter should be ready to use. Transfer your mixture to your resealable container.
// 17. You now have sourdough starter. Whenever your sourdough starter is used, replenish the starter with an equivalent amount of flour and water – one cup of starter would be substituted with one cup of flour and three fourths of a cup of water, for reference.

// Rock paper scissors
// 1. Initiate game
// 2. Randomize variables “rock”, “paper”, “scissors”
// 3. Accept user input “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”
// 4. Select a randomized variable
// 5. Output randomized variable
// 6a. If user input = “rock”, then variable “scissors” = loss and variable “paper” = win
// 6b. If user input = “paper”, then variable “scissors” = win and variable “rock” = lose
// 6c. If user input = “scissors”, then variable “rock” = loss and variable “paper” = win
// 7. Validate user input
// 8. Display user input and selected variable
// 9. isplay result screen showing player loss or win
