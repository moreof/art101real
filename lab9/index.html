			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The primary challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuery to add buttons on our websites which can toggle between different sections.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was having trouble getting this to work for quite a while, and I tried troubleshooting in a variety of ways. At first, I thought maybe I needed to include the dot sign to indicate the 'special' class when toggling, but that wasn't it. After a couple days of occasionally coming back and trying to figure it out, it hit me that I was only toggling one class without indicating the other. I noticed that the buttons would toggle some changes in their respective sections, but not all of them, and I realized it might by trying to toggle the class "special" on without trying to toggle the minor-section class off.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was a bit frustrating in retrospect how long it took to diagnose such a simple problem, but I think that's also part of the experience of coding and the learning curve. I really enjoyed figuring this out as well, because it feels more technically involved than some of our previous work.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The results for this lab can be seen by pressing the buttons in each section.</p>
